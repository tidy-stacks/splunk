This Splunk assignment uses 4 sets of data to analyze a cybersecurity incident at fictional corporation.


The bootcamp spent 3 weeks hammering home all the potential benefits a tool like Splunk gives a SOC. The biggest of them being setting up bespoke rules and alerts based on a data driven approach. Equally important is the data visualizations. The data visualizations along with the dashboard really bring data vizualizations to a whole new level of access and understanding with the single pane of glass approach Splunk expertly designs. 

Included here are the review questions with the file entitled Splunk Report and the silde deck used to present the conclusions from the report entitled Splunk Conclusion that outlines some mitigation strategies that can be impplemented from the data.
